Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

0. Definitions.

The “Program” refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this License.

A “Modified Version” of the Program means any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another language.

“Object” form means any form resulting from mechanical transformation or translation of a Source form, including but not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation, and conversions to other media types.

A “Service” means a service under which the Program or a portion of it is used to provide a service for the benefit of others, whether through a network or other means of providing access to the functionality of the Program.

To “modify” a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an exact copy. The resulting work is called a “modified version” of the earlier work or a work “based on” the earlier work.

A “User” is someone who is in a contractual agreement with a provider of a Service or in a non-contractual relationship with a provider of a Service for the use of the Service, whether directly or indirectly, but excluding those users who have been granted access to the Service by the provider of the Service under any other terms.

“Source Code” refers to the preferred form for making modifications, including but not limited to software source code, documentation source, and configuration files.

1. Source Code Availability.

The Service provided by the Program must be accompanied by the corresponding Source Code. The Provider of the Service may charge a fee for providing the Source Code. The fee charged for providing the Source Code must not exceed the cost of providing the Service. The fee charged for providing the Source Code must be no more than the fee charged for providing the Service to others.

2. Grant of Patent License.

Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Program, where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s) with the Program to which such Contribution(s) was submitted.

3. Limitations.

- In order to enable the Licensee to exercise its rights under Section 1, the Licensee must provide notice of the existence of the License and the availability of the Source Code to each person to whom the Licensee distributes the Program.

- The Licensee must include a copy of this License with every copy of the Program the Licensee distributes or with every modification the Licensee makes to the Program.

- If the Licensee makes modifications to the Program, the Licensee must include a prominent notice that the Program has been modified and the date of modification in any copies of the Program the Licensee distributes.

4. Termination.

The Licensee’s rights under this License will terminate automatically without notice from the Licensor if the Licensee fails to comply with any term(s) of this License.

5. Disclaimer of Warranty.

THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED “AS IS”, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT. IN NO EVENT SHALL THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY CLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM, OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE PROGRAM OR THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN THE PROGRAM.
